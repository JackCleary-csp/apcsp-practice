# AP CSP Day 10: input/output scaffold, not a completed binary report.
# In your existing binary_clock_math.py, preserve your lists, labels, index,
# conversion, report features, and test comments. Use your existing variable names.
# These sample lists make this template runnable on its own.
values = [13, 45, 63]
labels = ["Sample A", "Sample B", "Sample C"]
selected_index = 0

# PROVIDED INPUT: Run, click the Terminal, type an integer, and press Enter.
# Text and decimal input handling is outside today's task.
values[selected_index] = int(input("Enter a number: "))
clock_value = values[selected_index]
selected_label = labels[selected_index]
print("You entered:", clock_value)

# YOUR CODE START
# 1. Add a range decision for whole numbers from 0 through 63.
is_in_range = clock_value >= 0 and clock_value < 64

# 2. Put your existing extraction, bit_text, reconstruction, and report
#    inside the valid branch. Keep the selected label in the report.

# 3. Inside that branch, add an even/odd decision using the remainder.
# 4. In the invalid branch, print only the invalid message after the input echo.
# YOUR CODE END

# OUTPUT PATTERNS: move/uncomment these only in the appropriate branches.
# print(selected_label + ": " + bit_text)
# print("Even")  # or print("Odd")
# print("Outside six-bit range")
